1. What design principles does this code violate?
	Simplicity; the if statements are unnecessarily convoluted and nearly impossible to read. Even just removing the ! operator and switching the accept and reject branches makes
	makes it significantly easier to understand the logic. And then splitting up the booleans within the if statement makes it even better.
2. Refactor the code to improve its design.

if (score > 700 || income > 100000) {
	accept();
} else if (income >= 40000 && authorized && score > 500) {
	accept();
} else {
	reject();
}

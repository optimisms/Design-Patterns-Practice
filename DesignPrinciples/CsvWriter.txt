1. What design principles does this program violate?
	Hyperdecomposition; the algorithm has been broken down into tiny parts, even down to printing individual characters in getQuoted. It's nearly identical to the example from the reading where a
	CreditCardNumber is represented by an array of Digits. It's taking the decomposition too far.
2. Refactor the program to improve its design.

CsvWriter.java

public class CsvWriter {
	public CsvWriter() {
	}

	public void write(String[][] lines) {
		for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
			String[] currLine = lines[i];
			for (int j = 0; j < currLine.length; j++) {
				if (isQuoted(currLine[j]) {  writeQuoted(currLine[j]);  }
				else {	System.out.print(currLine[j]);  }

				if (j < currLine.length - 1) {  System.out.print(",");  }
			}
			System.out.println();
		}			
	}

	private boolean isQuoted(String check) {  return (field.indexOf(',') != -1 || field.indexOf('\"') != -1);  }


	private void writeQuoted(String field) {
		String remainder = field;
		System.out.print('\"');
		while ((int index = remainder.indexOf('\"')) != -1) {
			System.out.print(remainder.substring(0, index) + "\"\"");
			remainder = remainder.substring(index);
		}
		System.out.print(remainder + '\"');
	}
}
